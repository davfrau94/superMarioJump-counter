<h1><a target="_blank" href="https://supermariojump-counter.netlify.app"/>SUPER MARIO JUMP COUNTER</a></h1>
<p>This project was created for the practical exam of the Javascript Basic course at <a href="https://www.start2impact.it">Start2Impact University</a>.</p>
<p>The objective was to develop a JavaScript application that allows the user to increase and decrease the value of the counter. 
Upon entering the page, the user will see 0 as the counter value and will have two +/- buttons available to change the counter value.</p>

<p>For the creation of this application, I was inspired by one of my favorite Nintendo characters, Super Mario, who with his jumps managed to overcome the obstacles he encountered.</p>

<p>As for the animation, I used a very cute one, created by <a href="https://www.albertopozo.com">Alberto Pozo</a>, a Barcelona based freelance designer and animator.</p>
